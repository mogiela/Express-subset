1. The hard part was to understand what was needed to be done in each part and how to combine it together

2. The fun part was when it worked

3. We build use functions that includes path and middleware and then tried to check them
with postman and see if they did what we wanted them to do.
we checked the req and res methods and properties that were needed to be implemented
and we check the test that was needed to be written.
for example, we checked the res.status in the form of a use function that changed the status of
res to 404 and hen send something and then we checked what status we got back.
